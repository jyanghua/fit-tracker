## Overview
### Description
Fit-tracker is an app that will allow users to track the progress of their workouts over time. 
The user will be able to add a workout session where they will input the type of workout (e.g. pushup, curls, squats)
and how many reps or how long. The user will also be able to see their workout history and peformance growth. 
Due to time constraints, the user will be allowed to focus on specific workouts such as pushups, curls, and squats. Ideally, users
will be able to add other excercises such as running, swimming, and situps.
